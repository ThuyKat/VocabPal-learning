## Session 6 — February 5, 2026

### What We Did

1. **Reviewed SCRUM-9 (Implement Dictionary API adapter)**
   - Katie completed all 6 subtasks (SCRUM-29 to SCRUM-33, SCRUM-39)
   - Code review on SCRUM-39 (DictionaryAdapter implementation)

2. **Code Review Feedback on SCRUM-39**
   - Issues found:
     - Missing `interface` declaration (created class instead of interface)
     - Used `extends` instead of `implements`
     - Missing exports
     - Extra space in class name
   - Katie asked about interfaces having methods → explained that interfaces declare method signatures (contract), classes provide implementation
   - Posted answer to Jira

3. **Katie Applied Fixes**
   - Created `DictionaryAdapter` interface in `types/index.ts`
   - Changed `FreeDictionaryAdapter` to use `implements DictionaryAdapter`
   - Added exports
   - SCRUM-39 approved and transitioned to Done

---

## Session 7 — February 7, 2026

### What We Did

1. **Code Review SCRUM-34 (Learn: Firestore CRUD operations)**
   - Reviewed Katie's learning notes — excellent documentation of all Firestore functions
   - Posted approval comment to Jira

2. **Code Review SCRUM-35 (Create wordService.ts with CRUD operations)**
   - Katie completed wordService.ts with all 5 CRUD operations

   **Round 1 - Initial review found 4 issues:**
   1. ❌ `id: data.id` should be `id: snapshot.id` — document ID is metadata, not in data
   2. ❌ Missing timestamps in `toFirestore()` — timestamps not being saved to Firestore
   3. ❌ `updateWord` missing `updatedAt` — should auto-set on updates
   4. ❌ Type mismatch: `QueryDocumentSnapshot` should be `DocumentSnapshot`

   **Round 2 - Katie fixed 2 of 4:**
   - ✅ Fixed `id: snapshot.id`
   - ✅ Fixed type to `DocumentSnapshot`
   - ❌ Still missing: timestamps not written to Firestore
   - ❌ Still missing: `updateWord` doesn't set `updatedAt`

   **Katie's question:** "Doesn't Firestore auto-generate timestamps?"
   - Answer: NO! Firestore only auto-generates document IDs, not timestamps
   - Added learning note to SCRUM-34 clarifying `Omit` controls caller input, not what's written to DB

   **Round 3 - Katie added `serverTimestamp()`:**
   - ✅ Added `serverTimestamp()` in `toFirestore()`
   - ❌ NEW issue: `updateWord` uses `toFirestore()` which overwrites `createdAt` on every update!

   **Round 4 - Final fixes:**
   - ✅ `updateWord` now directly sets only `updatedAt: serverTimestamp()`
   - ✅ `fromFirestore` uses `.toDate()` for Firestore Timestamps
   - ✅ Minor: `new Date(data.createdAt?.toDate())` is redundant but works

   **SCRUM-35 approved and transitioned to Done**

3. **Katie's Question: Why use `as` type assertion in wordService.ts?**
   - Katie asked about line 19: `const data = snapshot.data(options||{}) as Omit<Word, ...>`
   - Explained: `snapshot.data()` returns generic `DocumentData | undefined`, TypeScript doesn't know the shape
   - Type assertion tells TypeScript what fields exist so we can access `data.word`, `data.definition`, etc.
   - Added learning note as comment on SCRUM-10

### Current Status

- **Sprint:** Sprint 1 - Foundation (ACTIVE)
- **SCRUM-6:** Done ✓
- **SCRUM-7:** Done ✓

2. Then SCRUM-37 (authService.ts)
3. Then SCRUM-38 (export all services)

---

## Session 8 — February 8, 2026

### What We Did

1. **Java Concepts Deep Dive (Learning Discussion)**

   Katie initiated a discussion about Java OOP concepts to solidify understanding. Topics covered:

   **Interface vs Abstract Class:**
   | Use Interface When | Use Abstract Class When |
   |-------------------|------------------------|
   | Need multiple inheritance | Need shared state (instance fields) |
   | Defining a contract/capability | Have partial implementation |
   | Want loose coupling | Need constructors |
   | "Can do" relationship | "Is a" relationship |

   **Key Learnings:**
   - Abstract class CAN implement an interface (common pattern!)
   - Interface fields are always `public static final` (constants only)
   - Abstract classes can have any type of field (static, instance, mutable)
   - Default methods in interfaces provide shared behavior but can't access instance state

   **Java Modifiers:**
   - Access modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`, (default)
   - Non-access modifiers: `static`, `final`, `abstract`, `synchronized`, `volatile`, `transient`
   - `static` = belongs to class (shared across instances, mutable)
   - `static final` = belongs to class (constant, immutable)

   **Interface Decision Flow:**
   ```
   Need multiple inheritance?     → Interface
   Need instance fields?          → Abstract class
   Just defining a contract?      → Interface
   Need constructor?              → Abstract class
   "Can do" capability?           → Interface
   "Is a" relationship?           → Abstract class
   Both could work?               → Interface (more flexible)
   ```

2. **Career & Learning Discussion**

   - Discussed relevance of Java in AI era
   - Java still dominates: enterprise, banking, Android, big data (Hadoop/Spark/Kafka)
   - Python dominates AI/ML; TypeScript for web
   - Katie's learning approach: understanding "why" deeply rather than surface-level memorization
   - This approach differentiates developers — deep knowledge is rare

3. **Katie's Summary of Interface Usage:**
   - Loose coupling
   - Multiple inheritance of patterns/structures
   - Shared utility implementation via default methods
   - Can be extended by abstract class
   - Abstract class better when methods need instance fields

### Current Status

- **Sprint:** Sprint 1 - Foundation (ACTIVE)
- **SCRUM-10:** In Progress (SCRUM-34, SCRUM-35 done; SCRUM-36, 37, 38 remaining)
- **Blocked:** Nothing
- **Note:** This was a learning/discussion session, no code changes

### Next Steps

1. Continue with SCRUM-36 (categoryService.ts)
2. Then SCRUM-37 (authService.ts)
3. Then SCRUM-38 (export all services)

## Session 9 — February 10, 2026

### What We Did

1. **Code Review SCRUM-36 (categoryService.ts)**

   - SCRUM-36 approved and transitioned to Done

2. **Code Review SCRUM-37 (authService.ts)**
   - Initial review: implementation was good

   - Good patterns:
     - GoogleAuthProvider usage
     - onAuthStateChange subscription pattern
     - Proper error handling
   - SCRUM-37 approved and transitioned to Done

3. **Code Review SCRUM-38 (index.ts exports)**
   - Katie created barrel export file
   - Initial issue: removed `export` keywords from service files
   - Explained: `export *` only re-exports things already exported
   - Katie fixed by adding `export` back to all functions
   - SCRUM-38 approved and transitioned to Done

4. **Closed SCRUM-10 (Create Firebase service utilities)**
   - All 5 subtasks complete (SCRUM-34 to SCRUM-38)

     - SCRUM-7: TypeScript interfaces ✓
     - SCRUM-8: Firebase project ✓
     - SCRUM-9: Dictionary API adapter ✓
     - SCRUM-10: Firebase services ✓

6. **Deep Dive: Auth Patterns (SCRUM-37 discussion)**
   - Answered Katie's questions about onAuthStateChange:
     - Why it's different from getCurrentUser (async vs sync)
     - How React apps use useEffect + subscription pattern
     - Why variable is named `unsubscribe` (name by what it DOES)
     - How to build custom Observer pattern without Firebase

## Session 13 — February 26, 2026

### What We Did

1. **Fixed Jira API Token**
   - Token had expired — regenerated via Atlassian account settings
   - Updated `.env` with new token
   - Auth confirmed working

2. **Code Review SCRUM-124 (Learn: Testing in JavaScript/TypeScript - Vitest, RTL)**
   - Reviewed all 10 comments Katie left on the ticket
   - **Approved ✅**
   - Highlights:
     - vi.mock() explanation (Comment 4) — strongest note, understood mock module vs mock function vs mock data
     - Spy vs mock distinction (Comment 6) — correct: mocks replace, spies observe
     - AAA pattern (Comment 7) — thorough, covered all three organize-by strategies + beforeEach usage
     - getByRole vs getByTestId (Comment 9) — added accessibility angle (screen readers, keyboard users)
   - Minor notes:
     - Comment 10 (FireEvent) cut off mid-sentence; also noted `userEvent` is preferred over `fireEvent` in modern RTL
     - Comment 3 (Chai syntax) had no content
   - Posted `[Code Review Feedback]` comment on SCRUM-124 in Jira (comment ID: 10899)

### Current Status

- **Sprint 1:** COMPLETE ✅
- **Sprint 2:** IN PROGRESS
- **SCRUM-124:** Reviewed and approved ✅
- **Next ticket:** SCRUM-125 (next subtask under SCRUM-117)

### Next Steps

1. Continue with SCRUM-117 subtasks (SCRUM-125 onward)
2. Move into coding subtasks for the testing framework

## Session 12 — February 11, 2026

### What We Did

1. **Discussed Sprint Order**
   - Katie asked if Sprint 4 can be done before other sprints
   - Answer: No, Sprint 4 depends on Sprints 2 & 3
   - Sprint 4 (testing, CI/CD, deployment) requires having something built to test/deploy

2. **Discussed Deploying Original VocabPal**
   - Katie wants to deploy the original VocabPal (already built) first
   - Recommended keeping documentation separate from VocabPal-Learning
   - Suggested Option B: Light tracking (simple checklist in original repo)
   - Learning from deployment can inform Sprint 4 planning

3. **Updated SCRUM-124 with Reference Materials**
   - Katie asked for reference materials like Sprint 1 learning tasks
   - Added structured description to SCRUM-124 (Learn: Testing in JavaScript/TypeScript):
     - **Goal:** Understand Vitest and RTL fundamentals
     - **Watch (30-40 mins):** Vitest Crash Course, RTL Tutorial, Testing Hooks
     - **Read (20-30 mins):** Vitest guide, RTL intro, Query priority, Mocking guide
     - **Key Concepts:** describe/it, expect matchers, RTL philosophy, query priority, vi.mock(), vi.fn(), renderHook()
     - **Done When:** Can explain AAA pattern, mocking, query priority, testing data-fetching

### Current Status

- **Sprint 1:** COMPLETE ✅
- **Sprint 2:** IN PROGRESS
- **SCRUM-124:** Reference materials added
- **Original VocabPal:** Katie considering deployment

### Next Steps

1. Katie decides on approach for deploying original VocabPal
2. Continue with Sprint 2 or start learning testing (SCRUM-124)
