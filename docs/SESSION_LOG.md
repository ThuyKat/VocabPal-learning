## Session 1 — January 17, 2026

### What We Did

1. **Chose project management tool**

4. **Broke down SCRUM-6 into subtasks**
   - Katie requested smaller steps with learning materials
   - Created 7 subtasks (SCRUM-11 to SCRUM-17)

5. **Set up Confluence**
   - Katie added Confluence product to Atlassian site
   - Created space: VocabPal Learning Project (key: VP)
