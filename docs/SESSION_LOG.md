## Session 1 — January 17, 2026

### What We Did

1. **Chose project management tool**
   - Considered Rally vs Jira
   - Decided on Jira (more widely used, free tier, better for learning)

2. **Set up Jira**
   - Katie created Atlassian account and project (key: SCRUM)
   - Connected Claude to Jira API via API token
   - Created Epic SCRUM-5: VocabPal - Vocabulary Learning App
   - Created 5 Stories for Sprint 1 (SCRUM-6 to SCRUM-10)
   - Created Sprint 1 - Foundation (Jan 17-24)
   - Started the sprint

3. **Assessed Katie's skills**
   - React: Some experience
   - TypeScript: Basic
   - Firebase: Never used
   - Chrome Extensions: Built one before

4. **Broke down SCRUM-6 into subtasks**
   - Katie requested smaller steps with learning materials
   - Created 7 subtasks (SCRUM-11 to SCRUM-17)
   - Each includes: Goal, Steps, Learning resources, Done criteria

5. **Set up Confluence**
   - Katie added Confluence product to Atlassian site
   - Created space: VocabPal Learning Project (key: VP)
   - Created 4 documentation pages

6. **Created project folder**
   - Path: `/Users/katiem/Desktop/VocabPal-Learning`
   - Kept existing VocabPal intact (in active use by someone)
   - Initialized git repo
   - Created .gitignore and .env

### Current Status

- **Sprint:** Sprint 1 - Foundation (ACTIVE)
- **Current Ticket:** SCRUM-11 (Learn: What is a monorepo?) - NOT STARTED
- **Blocked:** Nothing

### Next Steps

1. Katie assigns SCRUM-11 to herself, moves to In Progress
2. Katie reads the monorepo articles (~10 mins)
3. Katie explains monorepo concept to Claude (verification)
4. Move to SCRUM-12 (Create root package.json)
